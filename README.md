**Project Title:** bad-bank
**Description/Motivation:** the reason why it call bad bank is because it has no security and the reason why this project exist is because is one of the project i did in my programming journey and still ongoing project. it was buid with nodejs and and some functions like promise syntax and call back
**Installation Guidelines:** how to get your project up and running on your local machine, fork and clone from my git repo  and run npm install from that directory. All code you will run in this activity will be from that directory
however if you want it to show all data stored from your local machine, you will need to install docker and run this command in your terminal "docker run -p 27017:27017 --name badbank -d mongo" Once it is running, check that it is functioning by navigating to localhost:27017 in a browser To verify that the test has been successful, you will need to download Robo 3T to an external site., which will allow you to browse your MongoDB database. Name the file mongo_test.js and run the node mongo_test.js command in the same directory as the file to test out your Docker MongoDB instance. 
Note: You will need to both initialize a node project in the same folder and run the npm install mongodb command in order to run the file
